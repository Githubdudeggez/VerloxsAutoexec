# VerloxsAutoexec
This is a paste of my CS2 Autoexec Config. This Autoexec includes every single setting in CS2 allowing you to always be able to play with the same settings on any account.

How to use this? Download the zip, Extract the zip, place Autoexec and the Verloxs folder in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg. Paste +exec autoexec.cfg in your CS2 launch options (go to CS2 in library, click manage, it is the gear icon)

The zip includes all cs2 settings + more which are set to my preference, open up any of the audio, bind, crosshair, hud, mouse, network, script, or video files and change whatever you want to your preference. Scripts includes an AFK move (spinning slowly or running straight, by default is bound to f1), and a bomb drop hotkey to quickly switch to the bomb, drop it, and switch back to your previous weapon (by default h). If you wish to change binds do not change the scancode or hotkey on the same line only change the command and description Example: if you wanted to bind slot1 from number 1 to the number 2 button you would delete inside the quotes where slot1 is and paste slot1 in the quotes on the line with scancode 31 and number 2, the description is not required but is nice to switch as well if you make alot of changes.
bind "scancode30"     "slot1"                                   // [1] Equip: Primary weapon.
bind "scancode31"     "slot2"                                   // [2] Equip: Secondary weapon (pistols).
